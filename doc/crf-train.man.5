.SH NAME
.B crf-train file format

.SH INPUT DESCRIPTION
The input to \fBcrf-train\fR are sequences of 
\fIlabeled and annotated sequences\fR.
Each labeled and annotated sequence consists out of several lines 
each with at least two columns (separated by tabs),
containing an input token followed by the corresponding 
output label and a sequence of attributes (strings).
Sequences are separated by each other by an empty line.
More formally, the input is specified by the following regular expressions:

.br 
<INPUT-CORPUS> = (<LABELED-ANNOTATED-SEQ> <NL>)+
.br 
<LABELED-ANNOTATED-SEQ> = (<INPUT-TOKEN> <TAB> <OUTPUT-LABEL> (<ATTRIBUTES>?) <NL>)+
.br 
<INPUT-TOKEN> = <STRING>
.br 
<OUTPUT-LABEL> = <STRING>
.br
<ATTRIBUTES> = ATTR (<TAB> ATTR)*
.br 
<ATTR> = <STRING>

.SH OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
The model is written to a binary file which consist of several parts:
.br
- the attributes and their unique mapping to integers, 
.br
- the labels and their unique mapping to integers, 
.br
- the transitions
.br
- the labels and their attributes
.br
- the parameters.
