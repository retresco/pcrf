.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR -c " "CONFIGFILE ",  " --config " " CONFIGFILE
Configuration file which determines the features to be annotated to the input tokens
during application.
See crf-conf(5) for the format of this configuration file.

.TP
.BR -o " " {1,2,3} ",  "  --order {1,2,3}
Model order. 
The order of a CRF-model is roughly the same as the N in an N-gram model.
The model order must match the one specified during crf-train.

.TP
.BR -m " " MODELFILE ",  " --model " " MODELFILE
The CRF-model to be applied (as created by crf-train(1))

.TP
.BR -f " " FORMAT ",  " --format " " FORMAT
The output format. Currently, 
.B crf-apply
supports the following output formats:
a)
.B tsv 
outputs tab-separated data,
b)
.B json
outputs JSON format, and
c)
.B single-line
outputs first the whole input token sequence followed a tab followed by the whole label sequence.
Between the sequences, a newline is outputted.

.TP 
.BR -r ", " --runnning-text
If set, 
.B crf-apply 
assumes that is input is UTF-8 encoded running text. 
crf-annotate then extracts sequences from that input by using an heuristic 
sentence segmenter (for English). 
The sequences are tokenised, annotated with the user-specified attributes 
and then written to the output.
If not set, 
.B crf-apply
assumes tab-separated input data (see crf-annotate(1)).

.TP 
.BR -e ", " --eval
Switches on evaluation mode (requires input annotated with the correct labels).
Evaluation is currently only supported for tab-separated input and output data.

.TP 
.BR -h ", " --help
Displays usage information and exits.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B crf-apply 
applies a trained CRF-model (see crf-train(1)) to UTF-8 encoded input text data.
Text data can be either running text or tab-separated column data.
The output of 
.B crf-apply
can be rendered in different formats (see -f option) 
and is written to stdout.
crf-apply also has an evaluation mode which requires input annotated with the correct labels.
In that case, 
.B crf-apply
also outputs accuracy, precison, recall and F1-score.

.SH BUGS
The outputters are currently not general enough. 
Not all combinations of input format, output format and evaluation mode are possible.
The model order could be inferred from the model file.
