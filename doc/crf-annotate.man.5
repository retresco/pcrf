.SH INPUT DESCRIPTION
The input to 
.B crf-annotate
are sequences of labeled sequences.
Each labeled sequence consists out of two-column lines (separated by a tab)
each containing an input token followed by the corresponding output label.
Labeled sequences are separated by each other by an empty line.
More formally, the input is specified by the following regular expressions:

.br 
<INPUT-CORPUS> = (<LABELED-SEQ> <NL>)+
.br 
<LABELED-SEQ>  = (<INPUT-TOKEN> <TAB> <OUTPUT-LABEL> <NL>)+
.br 
<INPUT-TOKEN>  = <STRING>
.br 
<OUTPUT-LABEL> = <STRING>
